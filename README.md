# Tiktak - A Constructed Language

**Tiktak** - a constructed language designed for maximum clarity and ease of learning. The name embodies the rhythmic CVC-CVC pattern that characterizes the language's phonological structure.

## Design Principles

1. **Maximum clarity**: Words in same contexts are maximally distinct
2. **Minimal error-prone**: Avoid similar-sounding roots
3. **Efficiency**: Short roots (1-2 syllables) for common concepts
4. **Phonetic consistency**: Each letter always pronounced the same
5. **Verb-centric worldview**: Things are primarily defined by what they do, not just what they are. Nouns are often built from verbs, describing function or action (e.g., vismet = see-with = eye, panmak = food-maker = cook, vingo = air-go = wind)
6. **Compositional vocabulary**: Build complex words from simple roots (e.g., kintal = person-speak = language, firkol = fire-color = red)
