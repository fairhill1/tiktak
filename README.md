# Kintal - A Constructed Language

**Kintal** (from *kin* = person + *tal* = speak) is a constructed language designed for maximum clarity and ease of learning.

## Design Principles

1. **Maximum clarity**: Words in same contexts are maximally distinct
2. **Minimal error-prone**: Avoid similar-sounding roots
3. **Efficiency**: Short roots (1-2 syllables) for common concepts
4. **Phonetic consistency**: Each letter always pronounced the same
5. **Compositional vocabulary**: Build complex words from simple roots (e.g., kintal = person-speak = language, firkol = fire-color = red)

## Quick Start

### Basic Sentence Structure
Kintal uses **SVO** (Subject-Verb-Object) word order:
- **mi hav pan** = I have food
- **tu go dom** = you go home

### Pronunciation
- 5 vowels: **a e i o u** (pronounced: ah, eh, ee, oh, oo)
- 11 consonants: **p t k m n s f l r h v**
- No phonemic stress or tone

### Key Features
- **Compositional words**: Complex concepts from simple roots
  - **akdom** = water-house = bathroom
  - **panlok** = food-place = restaurant
  - **kintal** = person-speak = language

- **Simple grammar**: Minimal inflection
  - Plural: add **-im** (kin → kinim)
  - Tense: particles **pas** (past), **fut** (future)
  - Possession: add **-n** to pronouns (mi → min)

- **Consistent conjunctions**:
  - **en** = and
  - **ve** = or
  - **fu** = if
  - **ba** = but (concession)
  - **nesam** = however (contrast)

## Examples

**Basic phrases:**
