# The Lost Cat

A small cat lives in the village. The cat is black and white. Her name is Luna.

One day, Luna walks into the forest. She sees a bird. She runs after the bird. The bird flies away.

Luna looks around. She does not know this place. The trees are tall. The sun is going down. Luna is afraid.

She hears water. She walks to the river. At the river, she sees a old woman. The woman has bread and fish.

"Are you lost, little cat?" the woman asks.

Luna says "meow" many times.

The woman smiles. "I know your home. Come with me."

They walk together through the forest. Soon Luna sees her house. She is happy.

Luna runs to her house. She looks back at the woman. The woman waves goodbye.

Now Luna stays near her home. She does not chase birds into the forest anymore.
