# Constructed Language - Core Root Vocabulary

## Design Principles
* **Maximum clarity**: Words in same contexts maximally distinct
* **Minimal error-prone**: Avoid similar-sounding roots
* **Efficiency**: Short roots (1-2 syllables) for common concepts
* **Phonetic consistency**: Each letter always pronounced the same
* **Compositional vocabulary**: Build complex words from simple roots (e.g., kintal = person-speak = language, firkol = fire-color = red)

## Phonology
**Consonants**: p, t, k, m, n, s, f, l, r, h, v (11)  
**Vowels**: a, e, i, o, u (5)  
**Syllable structure**: (C)V(C)

**Design notes**: 
- Dropped 'w' for maximum clarity - too similar to u/o glide
- Dropped 'j' for maximum clarity - too similar to i glide (i-consonant)

Pronunciation guide:
- a = "ah" (as in father)
- e = "eh" (as in bed)
- i = "ee" (as in machine)
- o = "oh" (as in note)
- u = "oo" (as in boot)

## Grammar

### Plural
**Marker**: -im (suffix)

Examples:
- kin ‚Üí **kinim** (person ‚Üí people)
- dom ‚Üí **domim** (house ‚Üí houses)
- pan ‚Üí **panim** (food ‚Üí foods)
- sol ‚Üí **solim** (day ‚Üí days)

**Usage**: Attach directly to noun root
- mi hav pan = I have food
- mi hav panim = I have foods

### Tense
**System**: Separate particles placed BEFORE the verb

**Markers**:
- **pas** = past tense
- **fut** = future tense
- (unmarked) = present/timeless

Examples:
- mi **pas** go dom = I went home
- tu **fut** hav pan = you will have food
- na go dom = we go home (present)
- kin **pas** vis sol = person saw sun
- ka **fut** tal = he/she will speak

**Design note**: Verbs remain unchanged - tense is purely contextual via particles

### Word Order
**Basic structure**: SVO (Subject-Verb-Object)

**Standard sentence pattern:**
- Subject - (Tense) - Verb - Object
- Subject - Verb - Object (present/unmarked tense)

Examples:
- **mi hav pan** = I have food
- **tu pas go dom** = you went home
- **kin fut mak domim** = person will make houses
- **na vis sol** = we see sun

**With negation:**
- Subject - (Tense) - **ne** - Verb - Object
- **mi ne hav pan** = I not have food = I don't have food
- **tu pas ne go dom** = you past not go home = you didn't go home

**With adjectives:**
- Adjective follows noun: Noun - Adjective
- **dom big** = house big = big house
- **pan hot** = food hot = hot food
- **mi hav pan hot** = I have hot food

**Design note**: Fixed word order eliminates need for case markers on subject/object. Only possession requires marking.

### Possession
**System**: Suffix **-n** on pronouns to create possessive forms

**Possessive pronouns:**
- mi ‚Üí **min** (my)
- tu ‚Üí **tun** (your - singular)
- ka ‚Üí **kan** (his/her/their - singular)
- na ‚Üí **nan** (our)
- nu ‚Üí **nun** (your - plural)

**Usage**: Possessive-Pronoun + Noun
- **min dom** = my house
- **tun pan** = your food
- **kan solim** = his/her days
- **nan kinim** = our people

Examples in sentences:
- mi hav **min dom** = I have my house
- tu pas go **tun dom** = you went (to) your home
- **kan pan** es hot = his/her food is hot

**For non-pronoun possession** (noun owning noun):
- Use structure: Noun‚ÇÅ - **in** - Noun‚ÇÇ = Noun‚ÇÇ of Noun‚ÇÅ
- **kin in dom** = person's house (house of person)
- **sol in lit** = sun's light (light of sun)

### Questions
**System**: Use question words in place of the unknown element, maintain SVO word order

**Question words:** ko (who), ket (what), kor (where), ken (when), kim (why), kom (how)

**Question formation:**
- Replace unknown element with question word
- No word order change needed
- Optional: Add question particle at end for clarity (TBD)

**Examples:**

*Who questions:*
- **ko go dom?** = who goes home?
- **ko hav pan?** = who has food?
- **tu vis ko?** = you see who?

*What questions:*

- **tu hav ket?** = what do you have?
- **kin mak ket?** = person makes what?

*Where questions:*

- **tu go kor?** = where do you go?
- **min dom es kor?** = where is my house?

*When questions:*

- **ken tu pas hav pan?** = when did you have food?

*Why questions:*

- **kim pan es hot?** = why is food hot?

*How questions:*
- **kom tu mak dom?** = how do you make house?
- **kom kin go?** = how does person go?

*How many/much (compositional):*
- **kom mani kinim?** = how many people? (literally: how much people)
- **tu hav kom mani pan?** = how much food do you have?
- **kom big dom?** = how big (is) house?
- **kom rap tu go?** = how rap do you go?

**With tense:**
- **ko pas go dom?** = who went home?
- **tu fut hav ket?** = what will you have?

### Compound Words
**System**: Combine roots to create new words - maximize vocabulary from minimal roots

**Formation**: Root‚ÇÅ + Root‚ÇÇ (no spaces, no hyphens)
- Structure: Modifier + Head (what kind of thing it is)
- Pronunciation: Each letter still pronounced individually

**Compound vs Phrase:**
- **Compound** = single lexicalized concept with fixed meaning
  - Written as one word: **akdom**, **panlok**

  - Written as separate words: **dom big** (any big house)

**Examples:**
