# Tiktak - A Constructed Language

**Tiktak** - a constructed language designed for maximum clarity and ease of learning. The name embodies the rhythmic CVC-CVC pattern that characterizes the language's phonological structure.

## Design Principles

1. **Maximum clarity**: Words in same contexts are maximally distinct
2. **Minimal error-prone**: Avoid similar-sounding roots
3. **Efficiency**: Short roots (1-2 syllables) for common concepts
4. **Phonetic consistency**: Each letter always pronounced the same
5. **Verb-centric worldview**: Things are primarily defined by what they do, not just what they are. Nouns are often built from verbs, describing function or action (e.g., vismet = see-with = eye, panmak = food-maker = cook, vingo = air-go = wind)
6. **Compositional vocabulary**: Build complex words from simple roots (e.g., kintal = person-speak = language, firkol = fire-color = red)

## Documentation

- [Dictionary](dictionary.md) - Complete vocabulary and word list
- [Examples](examples.md) - Example phrases and stories
- [Grammar](grammar.md) - Grammar rules and sentence structure

## Quick Start

### Basic Sentence Structure
Tiktak uses **SVO** (Subject-Verb-Object) word order:
- **mi hav pan** = I have food
- **tu go dom** = you go home

### Pronunciation
- 5 vowels: **a e i o u** (pronounced: ah, eh, ee, oh, oo)
- 14 consonants: **p b t d g k m n s f l r h v**
- No phonemic stress or tone

### Key Features
- **Compositional words**: Complex concepts from simple roots
  - **akdom** = water-house = bathroom
  - **panlok** = food-place = restaurant
  - **kintal** = person-speak = language

- **Simple grammar**: Minimal inflection
  - Plural: add **-im** (kin → kinim, ka → kaim)
  - Tense: particles **pas** (past), **fut** (future)
  - Possession: add **-n** to pronouns (mi → min, kaim → kanim)

- **Consistent conjunctions**:
  - **en** = and
  - **ve** = or
  - **fu** = if
  - **bud** = but (concession)
  - **nesam** = however (contrast)

## Examples

**Basic phrases:**
- mi tal = I speak
- tu es bon = you are good
- na go panlok = we go to restaurant

**With tense:**
- mi pas hav pan = I had food
- tu fut go dom = you will go home
- mi pas go dom passol = I went home yesterday
- na fut vis tu futsol = we will see you tomorrow

**Questions:**
- ko hav pan? = who has food?
- tu vis ket? = what do you see?
- kor es min dom? = where is my house?

## Compound Words

**System**: Combine roots to create new words - maximize vocabulary from minimal roots

**Formation**: Root₁ + Root₂ (no spaces, no hyphens)

# Grammar

# Tiktak Grammar

## Word Order
**Basic structure**: SVO (Subject-Verb-Object)

**Standard sentence pattern:**
- Subject - (Tense) - Verb - Object
- Subject - Verb - Object (present/unmarked tense)

Examples:
- **mi hav pan** = I have food
- **tu pas go dom** = you went home
- **kin fut mak domim** = person will make houses
- **na vis sol** = we see sun

**With negation:**
- Subject - (Tense) - **no** - Verb - Object
- **mi no hav pan** = I not have food = I don't have food
- **tu pas no go dom** = you past not go home = you didn't go home

**With adjectives:**
- Adjective follows noun: Noun - Adjective
- **dom big** = house big = big house
- **pan hot** = food hot = hot food
- **mi hav pan hot** = I have hot food

**Time and place adverbs:**
- Can optionally be placed at the beginning of a sentence for emphasis or clarity
- Standard position: at the end (Subject - Verb - Object - Time/Place)
- Emphasis position: at the beginning (Time/Place - Subject - Verb - Object)

Examples:
- **mi go panlok sosol** = I go (to) restaurant today
- **sosol mi go panlok** = today I go (to) restaurant (emphasis on "today")
- **Monsol na makvak** = Monday we learn
- **solok kin es** = here person is
- **passol na pas gem** = yesterday we played

**Design note**: Fixed word order eliminates need for case markers on subject/object. Only possession requires marking.

## Plural
**Marker**: -im (suffix)

**For nouns:**
- kin → **kinim** (person → people)
- dom → **domim** (house → houses)
- pan → **panim** (food → foods)
- sol → **solim** (day → days)

**For third-person pronoun:**
- ka → **kaim** (he/she/it → they/them)

**Usage**: Attach directly to noun or pronoun root
- mi hav pan = I have food
- mi hav panim = I have foods
- ka tal = he/she speaks
- kaim tal = they speak

**Note**: Only **ka** takes the plural suffix. Other pronouns already distinguish singular/plural:
- mi (I) / na (we)
- tu (you-singular) / nu (you-plural)

## Tense
**System**: Separate particles placed BEFORE the verb

**Markers**:
- **pas** = past tense
- **fut** = future tense
- (unmarked) = present/timeless

Examples:
- mi **pas** go dom = I went home
- tu **fut** hav pan = you will have food
- na go dom = we go home (present)
- kin **pas** vis sol = person saw sun
- ka **fut** tal = he/she will speak

**Design note**: Verbs remain unchanged - tense is purely contextual via particles

## Possession
**System**: Suffix **-n** on pronouns to create possessive forms

**Possessive pronouns:**
- mi → **min** (my)
- tu → **tun** (your - singular)
- ka → **kan** (his/her/its)
- kaim → **kanim** (their - plural)
- na → **nan** (our)
- nu → **nun** (your - plural)

**Usage**: Possessive-Pronoun + Noun
- **min dom** = my house
- **tun pan** = your food
- **kan sol** = his/her day
- **kanim solim** = their days
- **nan kinim** = our people

Examples in sentences:
- mi hav **min dom** = I have my house
- tu pas go **tun dom** = you went (to) your home
- **kan pan** es hot = his/her food is hot
- **kanim dom** es big = their house is big

**For non-pronoun possession/relationships** (noun owning/relating to noun):

Two types:

**Possessive (ownership/belonging)** - use **su** ('s):
- Structure: Owner - **su** - Owned = Owner's Owned
- **kin su dom** = person's house
- **dog su kan** = dog's his/her = his/her dog

**Compositional (of)** - use **de** (of):
- Structure: Whole - **de** - Parts/Material/Topic = Whole of Parts
- **toktok de taltokim** = system of words
- **buk de kintal** = book of language (about language)

## Questions
**System**: Use question words in place of the unknown element, maintain SVO word order

**Question words:** ko (who), ket (what), kor (where), ken (when), kim (why), kom (how)

**Question formation:**
- Replace unknown element with question word
- No word order change needed
- Optional: Add question particle at end for clarity (TBD)

**Examples:**

*Who questions:*
- **ko go dom?** = who goes home?
- **ko hav pan?** = who has food?
- **tu vis ko?** = you see who?

*What questions:*
- **ket es hot?** = what is hot?
- **tu hav ket?** = what do you have?
- **kin mak ket?** = person makes what?

*Where questions:*
- **kin es kor?** = where is person?
- **tu go kor?** = where do you go?
- **min dom es kor?** = where is my house?

*When questions:*
- **tu go dom ken?** = when do you go home?
- **ken tu pas hav pan?** = when did you have food?

*Why questions:*
- **kim tu go?** = why do you go?
- **kim pan es hot?** = why is food hot?

*How questions:*
- **kom tu mak dom?** = how do you make house?
- **kom kin go?** = how does person go?

*How many/much (compositional):*
- **kom mani kinim?** = how many people? (literally: how much people)
- **tu hav kom mani pan?** = how much food do you have?
- **kom big dom?** = how big (is) house?
- **kom rap tu go?** = how rap do you go?

**With tense:**
- **ko pas go dom?** = who went home?
- **tu fut hav ket?** = what will you have?

## Tag Questions
**System**: Add **no?** at the end of any statement to turn it into a tag question

**Pattern:** [Complete Statement] + , **no?**

**Usage:** This pattern works universally, regardless of tense or verb (much simpler than English's varied tag questions)

**Examples:**
- **tu go dom, no?** = you go home, no? = you're going home, aren't you?
- **es bon, no?** = is good, no? = it's good, isn't it?
- **ka pas vis so, no?** = he saw this, no? = he saw this, didn't he?
- **na fut tal, no?** = we will speak, no? = we'll speak, won't we?
- **tu hav pan, no?** = you have food, no? = you have food, don't you?
- **mi es rit, no?** = I am right, no? = I'm right, aren't I?

## Subordinate Clauses
**System**: Question words can also function as conjunctions to introduce dependent clauses

**Pattern**: Question Word + Clause = subordinate clause that adds information to the main sentence

**Question words as conjunctions:**
- **ken** = when (temporal)
- **kor** = where (locative)
- **ko** = who (relative, person)
- **ket** = what (relative, thing)
- **kom** = how (manner)
- **kim** = why (reason)

**Context distinguishes usage:**
- Questions end with **?** and have interrogative intonation
- Subordinate clauses are embedded in larger sentences

**Examples:**

*ken (when) - temporal clauses:*
- **ken mi pas vis tu, tu pas slep** = when I saw you, you were sleeping
- **ken kaim pas vis ket Lorkhan pas mak, kaim pas maks firspir** = when they saw what Lorkhan had made, they became furious
- **mi fut tal pa tu ken tu go dom** = I will speak to you when you go home

*kor (where) - locative clauses:*
- **mi no vis kor tu go** = I don't see where you go
- **kor mi pas vit, sol pas es hot** = where I lived, the sun was hot
- **tu pod go kor tu vol** = you can go where you want

*ko (who) - relative clauses for people:*
- **kin ko pas tal met mi es min maksvolkin** = the person who spoke with me is my partner
- **mi vis ko tu tal pa** = I see who you speak to
- **ko hav pan pod hav vit** = who has food can have life

*ket (what) - relative clauses for things:*
- **mi no vis ket tu mak** = I don't see what you make
- **ket tu tal es bon** = what you say is good
- **mi vol makvak ket tu makvak mi** = I want to learn what you teach me

*kom (how) - manner clauses:*
- **mi tal kom mi tal** = I speak how I speak = I speak as I speak
- **tu no vis kom big so es** = you don't see how big this is
- **makvak mi kom mak so** = teach me how to make this

*kim (why) - reason clauses:*
- **mi vis kim tu go** = I see why you go = I understand why you go
- **kim tu mak so es no visbon** = why you make this is not clear

**Complex example:**
- **mi no vis ket tu vol ken tu no tal** = I don't see what you want when you don't speak
  - Main clause: **mi no vis** (I don't see)
  - First subordinate: **ket tu vol** (what you want)
  - Second subordinate: **ken tu no tal** (when you don't speak)

## Prepositions
**Core prepositions** for expressing relationships:

**pa** = to/for (recipient, benefactive)
- **mi mak dom pa tu** = I make house for you
- **mi tal pa kinim** = I speak to people
- **pan pa mi** = food for me

**fra** = from (source, origin)
- **mi go fra dom** = I go from house
- **mi hav pan fra panlok** = I have food from restaurant
- **kin fra lok big** = person from big place

**met** = with (accompaniment, instrument)
- **mi go met tu** = I go with you
- **na hav panim met ak** = we have foods with water
- **kin mak dom met kinim** = person makes house with people

**sur** = over/above (spatial position)
- **foks hop sur dog** = fox jumps over dog
- **vingovit go sur dom** = bird goes over house
- **kin es sur ter** = person is above ground

**sub** = under/below (spatial position)
- **dog es sub dom** = dog is under house
- **fis go sub ak** = fish goes under water
- **kin slep sub bigvit** = person sleeps under tree

**Usage in sentences:**
- **mi vol mak pan mas bon pa tu** = I want (to) make better food for you
- **tu go fra kor?** = you go from where? = where do you come from?
- **na go panlok met kinim mani** = we go (to) restaurant with many people

## Comparatives and Superlatives
**System**: Particles to express comparison between things

**Markers:**
- **mas** = more (comparative)
- **maks** = most (superlative)
- **les** = less (comparative)
- **lest** = least (superlative)
- **sam** = same/equal/as (equality)
- **dan** = than (comparison marker)

**Comparative** (more/less X than Y):
- Structure: Noun₁ - mas/les - Adjective - dan - Noun₂
- **dom mas big dan dom** = house more big than house = this house is bigger than that house
- **dom les big dan dom** = house less big than house = this house is smaller/less big than that house
- Shorter: **mas big dan X** = more big than X = bigger than X

**Superlative** (most/least X):
- Structure: Noun - maks/lest - Adjective
- **dom maks big** = house most big = biggest house
- **dom lest big** = house least big = smallest house
- **kin maks rap** = person most rap = fastest person
- **kin lest rap** = person least rap = slowest person

**Equality** (as X as Y):
- Structure: Noun₁ - sam - Adjective - Noun₂ (optional)
- **dom sam big** = house same big = equally big house
- **mi sam old tu** = I same old you = I'm as old as you

**Examples:**

*Comparatives:*
