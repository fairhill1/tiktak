### Example 11: The Birth of Eslaf Erol (Elder Scrolls Lore)

Eslaf Erol pas es fin de fif smalkin samtimmak de fem-sur-kin de surkin-ter Nordic havmani de Erolgard, Lahpyrcopa, en kan maksvol, surkin de Erolgard, Ytluaf. Ken ka pas hav smalkinim in, femsurkin pas es mas durep lad dan ald. Mak smalkinim pas ned 3 lunrep en sik sol. Pod es visbon kim ken femsurkin gev ud Eslaf, ka mak badtalmet, tal 'bon gofra', en rip.

Sam mani Nords, Ytluaf ne vol big kan maksvolkin en les kan smalkinim. Fra so, kan kinim pas es patnul, ken ka tal ka fut gomet passtil de-big-pas de kan kin de Atmora pa gomet kan maksvolkin in rip. Kinim pas ne vis kaim maksvol met kaim, en ne pas vis so passtil es. Bud, kanim pas havtak, so vittal surkinim makles kaim lentim. Lentim pas es repmani durtok in maks nulvis tokim de Skyrim, mas en frostim.

Ka makun kan domkinim en kan fif smalsurkinim, badlad en ak-vismet, en div kan tokim. Pa kan virsmalkin Ynohp, ka gev kan surnam, pa kan virsmalkin Laernu, ka gev kan ter, pa kan virsmalkin Suoibud, ka gev kan manitok; pa ka femsmalkin Laicifitra, ka gev kan hittok-kinim. Ytluaf su makvakkin tal ka ne fut div ka, pa bon surkin-ter, bud Ytluaf ne vol big kan makvakkin, ne sukrin-ter. Ken ka pas tal fin, ka gosur kan pufmet met smaldivmet.

*(Eslaf Erol was the last of the litter of five born to the Queen of the prosperous Nordic kingdom of Erolgard, Lahpyrcopa, and her husband, the King of Erolgard, Ytluaf. During pregnancy, the Queen had been more than twice as wide as she was tall, and the act of delivery took three months and six days after it had begun. It is perhaps understandable that the Lahpyrcopa elected, upon expelling Eslaf to frown, say, 'Good riddance,' and die.

Like many Nords, Ytluaf did not care very much for his wife and less for his children. His subjects were puzzled, therefore, when he announced that he would follow the ancient tradition of his people of Atmora of following his beloved spouse to the grave. They had not thought they were particularly in love, nor were they aware that such a tradition existed. Still, the simple people were grateful, for the little royal drama alleviated their boredom, which was and is a common problem in the more obscure parts of northern Skyrim, particularly in wintertide.

He gathered his household staff and his five fat, bawling little heirs in front of him, and divided his estate. To his son Ynohp, he gave his title; to his son Laernu, he gave his land; to his son Suoibud, he gave his fortune; to his daughter Laicifitra, he gave his army. Ytluaf's advisors had suggested he keep the inheritance together for the good of the kingdom, but Ytluaf did not particularly care for his advisors, or the kingdom, for that matter. Upon making his announcement, he drew his dagger across his throat.)*
