**Core digits (0-10):**

**Large numbers:**

- Hundreds: tri-sen-du-des-fif = 325 (3-100-2-10s-5)

**Examples:**
- 15 = des-fif
- 23 = du-des-tri
- 100 = sen (or un-sen)

## Compound Words

**System**: Combine roots to create new words - maximize vocabulary from minimal roots

**Formation**: Root₁ + Root₂ (no spaces, no hyphens)
- Structure: Modifier + Head (what kind of thing it is)
- Pronunciation: Each letter still pronounced individually

**Compound vs Phrase:**
- **Compound** = single lexicalized concept with fixed meaning
  - Written as one word: **akdom**, **panlok**
- **Phrase** = compositional, literal meaning
  - Written as separate words: **dom big** (any big house)

**Examples:**

*Places:*
- **akdom** = water-house = bathroom
