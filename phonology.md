# Kintal Phonology

## Sound System

**Consonants**: p, t, k, m, n, s, f, l, r, h, v (11)
**Vowels**: a, e, i, o, u (5)
**Syllable structure**: (C)V(C)

## Design Notes

- Dropped 'w' for maximum clarity - too similar to u/o glide
- Dropped 'j' for maximum clarity - too similar to i glide (i-consonant)
- No phonemic stress/tone - maximizes clarity and learnability

## Pronunciation Guide

**Vowels:**
- **a** = "ah" (as in father)
- **e** = "eh" (as in bed)
- **i** = "ee" (as in machine)
- **o** = "oh" (as in note)
- **u** = "oo" (as in boot)

**Consonants:**
All consonants are pronounced as in English, with consistent pronunciation in all contexts.

## Stress and Tone

**Not phonemic**: Stress and tone do not change word meaning. Speakers may freely use them for emphasis, emotion, or rhythm.

This design choice maximizes:
- **Clarity**: No minimal pairs distinguished by stress/tone
- **Learnability**: No need to memorize stress patterns
- **Flexibility**: Speakers can use prosody naturally for expression
